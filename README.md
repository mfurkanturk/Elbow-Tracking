This project marks the elbow, wrist and shoulder joints in the human body using the mediapipe library, which detects joint locations in the human body.
The angle between the wrist and shoulder is calculated and the degree of the angle is sent to the ESP32 via serial port. 
The servo motor connected to the ESP32 is moved with the same angle.
